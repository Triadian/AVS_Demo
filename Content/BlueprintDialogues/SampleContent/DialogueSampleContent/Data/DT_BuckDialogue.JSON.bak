Coffee's on, stories are free, and if you can fix an engine with duct tape, you're family here.[br]\
Now, don't mind the mess—every stain tells a story and every tool's got a best friend.[br]\
You look like you've got a tale or two yourself. City folks don't usually wander this far out.[br]\
What's your story, partner? Need a fix, after some fast wheels, or just hunting for odd jobs?[br]\
[color=0,0,0]So, what brings you to Buck's garage today? Repairs, a race, or maybe some honest work?[/color][br][/color]",

Other mechanics would toss up their hands, but I see potential in every dent and scratch.[br]\
It’ll take some work, a little luck, and maybe a favor or two from Lady Fortune herself.[br]\
I might have a way to help you out, if you’re gutsy enough to take a ride on the wild side.[br]\

You’ve got a one-in-a-million shot with that car, and the Maze is your ticket out of trouble.[br]\
No one else in town will take a chance on a ride like yours, but I believe in second chances.[br]\
The Maze is tough, but fair; she respects grit and a dash of wild spirit more than plain luck.[br]\
It’s your call, sugar—grab the wheel or keep wandering, but don’t say Buck never tried![br]\

It’s not just mud and turns; there’s more twists than a rattler at a barn dance, I promise you.[br]\
Glory, bragging rights, and maybe some prize money await those brave enough to take the wheel.[br]\
I keep the rules fair, the coffee hot, and the stories even hotter—just ask the locals![br]\

Remember, here at Buck’s, effort counts double and laughter’s part of the tune-up.[br]\
